# Scala Collector

## Introduction

The Scala Collector is an event collector for [SnowPlow] [snowplow],
written in Scala.
It sets a third-party cookie (TODO), allowing user tracking across domains.
It is designed to be easy to setup on TODO.

The Scala Collector relies on TODO
for SnowPlow event logging, and is built on top of
TODO.
